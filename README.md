# Caloreator
## Struggling to have control over your diet?  Try recording your food intake with my application - Caloreator

My application allows the user to input any meal they consume with key nutrition facts.  Users that struggle with will power or would like to organize their food consumption onto a single program will enjoy and can benefit from using Caloreator.

## Description

- [Deployed API](https://shielded-sierra-15733.herokuapp.com/)

## Frontend Repository

- [Backend Link](https://github.com/KikiG13/Caloreator-Project4-Frontend)


## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- React
- Axios
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- JSX
- CSS

## Unsolved Problems

- Would like to add a list of set meals that User can select and populate their meal input with.  Would be nice to provide a random option too
- Would like to set up a calendar to help the user locate past meals or plan future meals
- Would like to calculate total nutrition consumption in a meal, day, week
- Would like to do more styling to get the website layout to match my wireframes

## Project Planning Process

The planning stage is a step that I want to improve my ability in as I get more experience in developing websites.  I started off writing out my user stories, then put together my wireframes, worked on my backend repo, and then my frontend.  I wanted to make sure I had all my API routes and requests sorted out before changing/adding features and then finally styling.

- The API expects to receive all Authentication (POST, PATCH, DELETE) routes
- The API expects to receive all Error Handler routes
- The API expects to receive all User (GET, POST, DELETE) routes

## Installation

1. [Download](../../archive/main.zip) this template.
1. Move the .zip file to your `sei/projects/` directory and Unzip it (creating a
   folder) -- **NOTE:** if the folder was already unzipped, use the `mv` command
   line to move it to the `sei/projects/` directory.
1. Rename the directory from express-api-template -> your-app-name.
1. Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1. Move into the new project and `git init`.
1. Replace all instances of `'express-api-template'` with your app name.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Ensure that you have `nodemon` installed by running `npm install -g nodemon`.
1. Ensure the API is functioning properly by running `npm run server`.
1. Once everything is working, make an initial commit.
6. Create a new repository on [github.com](https://github.com),
    _not GitHub Enterprise_.
7. Name the new repository with the same name used on Step 3.
8. Follow the instructions on your new repository's setup page. For details on
   how to push to Github, refer to the section on Github entitled **"â€¦or push an existing
   repository from the command line."** Further documentation can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).
   > **Note:** This last step will rename your default branch to **main**. This branch name will be used when deploying.
1. Before presentations follow the steps in [express-api-deployment-guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-flex-831/express-api-deployment-guide)
